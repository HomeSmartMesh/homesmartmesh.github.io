:::details{summary="Is the DWM3001 compatible with the previous generation DWM1001 ?"}
Yes, but only when using channel 5, which might requires specific calibration. Programs designed for channel 9 cannot be directly reused on channel 5.
:::

:::details{summary="What is PDoA:Phase Difference of Arrival how does it compare to TDoA:Time Difference of Arrival ?"}
PDoA is more precise than TDoA when differentiating anchors close to each other, but as soon as they're far enough it becomes ambiguous so TDoA and PDoA can be used as complementary to each other.

:::details{summary="Can the DWM3001 act as a TDoA anchor ? (not answered)"}
TBC
